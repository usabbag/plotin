# Plotin - Stock Analysis Tool v1.0 - Requirements Document

## Overview
The Stock Analysis Tool v1.0 is a Python-based application that retrieves stock market data and generates candlestick charts with technical indicators. This document outlines the core requirements for the first version, focusing specifically on data retrieval and visualization components. Scheduling and Telegram integration will be addressed in future versions.

## 1. Core Functionality

### 1.1 Stock Data Retrieval
- The system must fetch historical stock price data using the `yfinance` library.
- The system must support retrieving data in 4-hour time intervals.
- The system must be able to process multiple stock symbols defined in a configuration file.
- The system must handle API failures gracefully with appropriate error logging.

### 1.2 Technical Analysis
- The system must calculate Simple Moving Averages (SMA) for 50 and 128 periods using `ta-lib-python`.
- The system must properly align calculated indicators with price data.
- The system must validate that sufficient historical data exists to calculate the required indicators.

### 1.3 Chart Generation
- The system must create candlestick charts using the `mplfinance` library.
- The system must display 4-hour price candles on the charts.
- The system must overlay 50 and 128 period SMAs on the price charts with distinctive colors.
- The system must properly format chart titles, axes, and legends.
- The system must save generated charts as high-quality PNG images to a specified output directory.

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1 Development Environment
- Python 3.9 or higher must be used.
- All code must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

### 2.2 Dependencies
- Required packages:
  - `yfinance` (latest stable version)
  - `mplfinance` (latest stable version)
  - `ta-lib-python` (latest stable version)
  - `pandas` (compatible version with yfinance)
  - `numpy` (compatible version with pandas)
  - `matplotlib` (compatible version with mplfinance)

### 2.3 Code Structure
- Modular design with separate modules for:
  - Data retrieval
  - Technical analysis
  - Chart generation
  - Configuration management
  - Error handling
- Functions should be well-documented with docstrings.
- Variable and function names should follow Python naming conventions (snake_case).

## 3. Configuration Requirements

### 3.1 User Configuration
- The system must use a configuration file (`config.yaml` or `config.json`) to define:
  - Stock symbols to analyze
  - Time period to retrieve (e.g., last 30 days)
  - Chart output directory
  - Chart styling preferences

### 3.2 Default Settings
- Default chart colors:
  - Up candles: green
  - Down candles: red
  - 50 SMA: blue
  - 128 SMA: orange
- Default time period: 30 days of historical data
- Default interval: 4 hours

## 4. Error Handling and Logging

### 4.1 Error Handling
- The system must handle common exceptions:
  - Network connectivity issues
  - API rate limiting
  - Invalid stock symbols
  - Insufficient data for indicator calculation

### 4.2 Logging
- The system must implement comprehensive logging:
  - Information level: successful operations
  - Warning level: recoverable issues
  - Error level: issues preventing normal operation
  - Debug level: detailed information for troubleshooting


## 7. Deliverables

### 7.1 Required Deliverables
- Python source code for all modules
- Requirements.txt file listing all dependencies
- Sample configuration file
- README.md with setup and usage instructions

## 8. Implementation Priorities

1. Data retrieval module with yfinance
2. Technical analysis module with ta-lib
3. Chart generation module with mplfinance
4. Configuration management
5. Error handling and logging
6. Testing and documentation

# Scheduling and Telegram

Install Required Dependencies:
python-telegram-bot for Telegram integration
schedule or APScheduler for scheduling tasks
Implementation Plan:
Create a Telegram Integration Module:
Create a new file telegram_bot.py to handle Telegram API interactions
Set up a bot using BotFather on Telegram and get an API token
Implement functions to send messages and charts to users/channels
Create a Scheduling Module:
Create a new file scheduler.py to handle scheduling logic
Implement functions to schedule chart generation at specific times/intervals
Add this to the config.yaml for configurable schedules
Update Main Process Flow:
Modify main.py to include the scheduling and Telegram integration
Create an option to run the app continuously for scheduled operations
Would you like me to implement any of these components first? I would recommend starting with the Telegram integration since that's the actual delivery mechanism, then adding the scheduling functionality.
